##Data and R Scripts

1_Munge_Script: deletes timeouts, each participants RT data is fitted with Gamma distribution. Outliers (i.e. RTs outside 250ms<RT<95th percentile of Gamma) and incorrect answers are deleted.

2_GLMModel.R: fits GLMM model to Data, tests for significance. Two versions... Gamma as underlying distribution: no difference to pattern of signifcance. 

3_Contrasts_Roughness_Harmonicity.R: make sure script 2 is run first; planned contrasts fo high and low Delta_Roughness and Delta_Harmonicity.

4_Correlation_Wang.R: simple correlation test between Delta_Roughness for the expanded data extended to include artificial intervals. Uses raw (i.e. untransformed) Wang roughness values. 

5_Roughness_LHE.R: compares Low vs (High and Extreme) with Low vs High vs Extreme. [NB: as we collapse across each participant to create a priming index, we switch to simple lm rather than glmer (i.e we don't have random effect of participant)

6_Figure_1.R: creates Figure 1, needs cents_and_interval_labels.txt

7_Figure_2.R: creates Figure 2

8_Figure_3.R: creates Figure 3, needs Wang_results.csv

9_Wilcox tests: tests for congruency effects for each pair of intervals seperately

10_KSTESTS: checks that data fits Gamma distributions


FULL_Data_Raw.csv: PsyToolkit Data pasted into a big csv file
